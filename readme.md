Welcome to my first pygame-based game. My name is Vlad and 9 years old. I've been coding for couple of years 
starting with Scratch, a bit of JavaScript and now Python. I've built this game with the help of my dad.

This is rather simple shoot'em type of the game. It is retro-inspired with ASCII art simple geometry.

I hope you enjoyed it!
