# --==B.R.I.C.K.S==--
Welcome to my first pygame-based game. My name is Vlad and 9 years old. I've been coding for couple of years 
starting with Scratch, a bit of JavaScript and now Python. I've built this game with the help of my dad.

This is rather simple shoot'em type of the game. It is retro-inspired with ASCII art and simple geometry.

I hope you enjoyed it!

## How to run
As a prerequisite you need to have `Python3` and `git` installed 
in your system. You can find download instructions at https://www.python.org/downloads/ and https://git-scm.com/downloads
 
1. Make sure you have `pygame` library installed:
```commandline
pip3 install pygame
```

2. Clone this git project:

Alternatively you can download ZIP archive of this project and unzip it.

3. Change to `src` directory:
