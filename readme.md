Welcome to my pygame-based game. My name is Vlad and I'm 10 years old. I've been coding for couple of years 
starting with Scratch, a bit of JavaScript and now Python. I've built this game with the help of my dad.

This is rather simple shoot'em type of the game. It is retro-inspired with ASCII art and simple geometry. The
goal of the game is to kill of as many bricks as possible. Each brick that hits the bottom descreses the lives count.
Each brick you hit - gives you ammo or an extra live or a +1 score. 

I hope you enjoyed it!

## Gamepad 
Game works with the keyboard and [Buffalo Classic USB Gamepad](https://www.amazon.com/Buffalo-iBuffalo-Classic-USB-Gamepad/dp/B002B9XB0E).
